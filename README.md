# Breast Cancer Classification

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as either **Malignant** (cancerous) or **Benign** (non-cancerous) using logistic regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the built-in Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. It contains 569 samples with 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

Features include:
- Mean, standard error, and worst values of various tumor characteristics
- Measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, etc.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook (`Breast Cancer Classification.ipynb`) contains the complete code with the following workflow:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing
3. Train-test split (80-20 ratio)
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation

To make a prediction on new data:
```python
input_data = (13.54,14.36,87.46,566.3,0.09779,0.08129,0.06664,0.04781,0.1885,0.05766,0.2699,0.7886,2.058,23.56,0.008462,0.0146,0.02387,0.01315,0.0198,0.0023,15.11,19.26,99.7,711.2,0.144,0.1773,0.239,0.1288,0.2977,0.07259)
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1,-1)
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)

if (prediction[0] == 0):
    print('The Breast cancer is Malignant')
else:
    print('The Breast Cancer is Benign')
```

## Results
- Training accuracy: ~95.38%
- Testing accuracy: ~93.86%

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Perform feature selection to improve model performance
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
- Create a simple web interface for predictions
